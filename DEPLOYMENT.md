# Deployment Guide for Campus Hub

This guide will help you deploy your College Event Management application to Render.com.

## Prerequisites

1. **GitHub Account**: You need a GitHub account to host your code
2. **Render Account**: Sign up at [render.com](https://render.com) (free tier available)

## Step 1: Push Code to GitHub

### Option A: Using VS Code (Recommended)

1. Open the integrated terminal in VS Code
2. Initialize Git repository (if not already done):
   ```powershell
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit for deployment"
   ```

3. Create a new repository on GitHub:
   - Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
   - Name it `college-event-management` or similar
   - Don't initialize with README (you already have code)
   - Click "Create repository"

4. Connect and push your code:
   ```powershell
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Option B: Using GitHub Desktop

1. Download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
2. Open GitHub Desktop and publish your repository
3. Follow the prompts to push your code

## Step 2: Deploy to Render

1. **Sign up/Login to Render**
   - Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
   - Sign up using your GitHub account

2. **Create New Web Service**
   - Click "New +" → "Blueprint"
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Render will automatically detect the `render.yaml` file

3. **Review Configuration**
   - Render will create:
     - A web service (your Django app)
     - A PostgreSQL database
   - Click "Apply" to start deployment

4. **Wait for Deployment**
   - Initial deployment takes 5-10 minutes
   - You'll see build logs in real-time
   - Wait for "Build successful" and "Deploy successful"

## Step 3: Create Superuser (Admin Account)

After deployment succeeds:

1. In your Render dashboard, go to your web service
2. Click "Shell" in the left sidebar
3. Run this command:
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

4. Follow the prompts to create an admin account:
   - Username: (your choice)
   - Email: (your email)
   - Password: (secure password)

## Step 4: Access Your Deployed Application

Your app will be available at: `https://campus-hub.onrender.com` (or similar URL shown in Render)

### Important URLs:
- **Homepage**: `https://your-app.onrender.com/`
- **Admin Panel**: `https://your-app.onrender.com/admin/`
- **Events**: `https://your-app.onrender.com/events/`

## Important Notes

### Free Tier Limitations
- App sleeps after 15 minutes of inactivity
- First request after sleep takes 30-60 seconds to wake up
- Database expires after 90 days (can be renewed)

### Adding Environment Variables (Optional)

If you need to add custom environment variables:

1. Go to your web service in Render
2. Click "Environment" tab
3. Add variables:
   - `SECRET_KEY` - Auto-generated by Render
   - `DEBUG` - Set to `False`
   - `ALLOWED_HOSTS` - Add your custom domain if you have one

### Custom Domain (Optional)

To use a custom domain:
1. Purchase a domain from any registrar
2. In Render, go to Settings → Custom Domain
3. Add your domain and update DNS records

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Check build logs in Render dashboard
- Ensure all dependencies are in `requirements.txt`
- Verify Python version compatibility

### Static Files Not Loading
- Ensure `collectstatic` ran during build
- Check build logs for errors
- Verify WhiteNoise is installed

### Database Issues
- Migrations should run automatically via `build.sh`
- If needed, run manually via Shell: `python manage.py migrate`

### App Not Responding
- Check if app is in "sleeping" state (free tier)
- View logs for any runtime errors
- Ensure environment variables are set correctly

## Next Steps

After successful deployment:

1. **Test all functionality**: Login, create events, book venues, etc.
2. **Create initial data**: Add clubs, venues, and sample events
3. **Share the URL**: Give the link to users
4. **Monitor**: Check Render dashboard for metrics and logs

## Support
